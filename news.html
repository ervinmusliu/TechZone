                <h2 class="em-title">AI in 2025: Generative Tech, Robots, and Emerging Risks</h2>
                <p class="em-text">The past year saw artificial intelligence (AI) push the boundaries of what's possible, with industries racing to integrate its capabilities to boost productivity and automate complex tasks.
                    In 2024, AI advancements accelerated at a pace outstripping previous high-tech innovations, setting the stage for even greater disruption ahead. But with this rapid progress comes a risk: without human oversight, AI's missteps could be just as monumental as its breakthroughs.
                    Generative and agentic AI are already enhancing user's ability to obtain sophisticated content across various media, while AI-powered health care tools are reshaping diagnostics — outperforming human physicians in certain tasks. These developments signal a looming transformation in health care delivery, with AI poised to play an even bigger role in business and industrial operations.
                    The power of AI will also birth humanoid agents, noted Anders Indset, author and deep-tech investor in exponential technologies such as AI, quantum technology, health tech, and cybersecurity. As we step into 2025, the technology landscape is rapidly evolving, with a spotlight on humanoid agents.
                    “This year began with excitement surrounding large language models (LLMs) but is set to end with groundbreaking advancements in autonomous humanoid robots,” Indset told TechNewsWorld.
                    In 2024, the development of robots surged, with innovations that once seemed far off now coming into view. The long-anticipated release of fully autonomous humanoids — previously confined to industrial settings — is approaching, he observed.
                    The arrival of 2025 brings anticipation for the widespread adoption of AI in robotics, enhanced human-robot interactions, and the rise of robotics-as-a-service (RaaS) models. These will make advanced robotic solutions accessible to more industries, Indset explained, describing the ensuing transformative period for the robotics industry.
                    “Humanoid agents will reshape our interactions with technology and expand the possibilities for AI applications across different domains,” he predicted.</p>

                <h2 class="em-title">Web Raiders Unleash Global Brute Force Attacks From 2.8M IP Addresses</h2>
                <p class="em-text">A weeks-long brute force attack campaign by malicious actors has reached mammoth proportions, according to a non-profit security organization.
                    The Shadowserver Foundation reports that the campaign, which has been ongoing since January, involves as many as 2.8 million IP addresses daily, targeting VPN devices, firewalls, and gateways from vendors like Palo Alto Networks, Ivanti, and SonicWall.
                    “The recent wave of brute force attacks targeting edge security devices, as reported by Shadowserver, is a serious concern for cybersecurity teams,” said Brent Maynard, senior director for security technology and strategy at Akamai Technologies, a content delivery network service provider, in Cambridge, Mass.
                    “What makes this attack stand out is both its scale — millions of unique IPs attempting access daily — and the fact that it's hitting critical security infrastructure like firewalls, VPNs, and secure gateways,” Maynard told TechNewsWorld.
                    “These aren't just any devices. They're the frontline defenses that protect organizations from external threats. If an attacker gains control over them, they can bypass security controls entirely, leading to data breaches, espionage, or even destructive attacks.”
                    In a brute force attack, waves of passwords and usernames inundate a login target in an attempt to discover valid login credentials. Compromised devices may be used for data theft, botnet integration, or illegal network access.</p>

                <h2 class="em-title">Processor Wars: How Qualcomm Lost Its Early Lead</h2>
                <p class="em-text">Since Microsoft launched Copilot+, the past few months have been a battleground for PC manufacturers. Qualcomm initially had a huge lead, but then AMD and Intel came out with Copilot+ PCs that cut into that advantage.
                    AMD outperformed Intel with a broader line of compliant products, while Intel focused on the premium market. Meanwhile, Qualcomm saw its design wins decline, and the laptop PC market has shifted more in AMD's favor, though Intel remains the dominant player overall.
                    Why didn't we see the big shift to Qualcomm, and what happened to Intel that cost its CEO?
                    Let's break it down — and we'll close with my Product of the Week, which has been keeping my driveway clear for the last week or so.
            Microsoft rushed to market with Copilot+ for PCs with two primary features. One was Cocreator, a derivative of Dall-E, which could have been pretty handy (I use Dall-E a lot these days). The other was Recall, an automatic indexing tool designed to help users find hard-to-locate files. That was pretty much it at launch.
            However, Microsoft positioned Recall poorly and had to pull it back. Cocreator by itself on a laptop — as opposed to a desktop PC or workstation where folks usually mess with graphics — turned out to be not very interesting.
            So, for a time, Qualcomm had only Copilot+ PCs. People weren't too excited about Copilot+, and by the time Office began showcasing AI capabilities, PCs from AMD and Intel were available to run it. Unfortunately, Qualcomm's brand name wasn't as well known in PCs as AMD or Intel. In addition, Qualcomm's product had a compatibility problem that made it largely unacceptable in large companies, so enterprise and large business sales never really emerged outside of trials.
